# Codex

Codex is an experimental concept programing language powered by the OpenAI generative model of the same name.

## Introduction

> **Note:** Codex is a *concept language*, meaning that it is not intended for production use.

Codex is a programming language with minimal syntax where the behavior of the program is not explicitly defined. Instead, the behavior of Codex programs are described using plain English, and the actual implementation of the code is filled in by [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/), a generative model designed to produce code from natural language descriptions.
